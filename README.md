## Job content
Simulate an NGS dataset for two populations with a small reference genome (< 1 Mb) of yourchoice, each population with 10 diploid individuals, to address a hypothesis about populationdifferentiation.

- Establish a version-controlled directory system to host the project.
- Describe your simulation strategy and the hypothesis to test (positive, negative, orneutral selection).
- Use ANGSD to calculate thetas for each population and Fst between the twopopulations.
- Use ANGSD to calculate thetas for each population and Fst between the twopopulations.
- Visualize and interpret your results and report them in a reproducible manner.
